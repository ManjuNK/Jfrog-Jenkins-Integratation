Jfrog Artifactory?
==================
Jfrog Artifactory is a tool used in devops methodology to store artifacts (readily deployable code)

What is Artifact
----------------
The files that contain both compiled code and resources that are usedto compile them are know as artifacts. 
- They are readily deployable files.
								     	
- source code  -->  Build Tools  -->  Compilation  -->  Binary code -->  Dependencys/resources -->  Artifact

- in java an artifacts would be jar, war, ear...etc file
- in .net an artifacts would be .dll file

Source:-
-------
1. text                    <--->    Blob(raw data)
2. we compare two source files   <--->   we cannot compare two source files.               
3. based on the content we can version it   <--->   we version it by name
4. stored by override.         <--->   not stored by override

 								    	 
what is artifact Repository?
----------------------------
- An artifact repository is a repository which can store multiple different versions of artifacts.each
  time the ware or tar.gz file is created. it stored in a server dedicated for the artifacts.

why artifact Repository?
------------------------

 source code  --> Compilation  -->  Test  -->  Review  -->  Successful  -->  Deploy

in real-time in the above process if you have any error in test env, we will rollback to version control to fix it. instead of that if you store artifacts in repo we can rollback to prevision version.
